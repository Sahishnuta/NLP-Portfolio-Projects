## [Project 1: Cybersecurity Text Classification](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Cyberbulling_Text_Classification)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the insights of the chat data. The data is sourced from a group that I was part of. I just downloaded the chat as a text file from WhatsApp.

## [Project 2: Extraction of Keywords](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Keyword_Extractor)

This project aims to distinguish between a signal process that produces Higgs bosons and a background process that does not.

## [Project 3: Keyword Spotting](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Keyword_Spotting)

This projects aim to detect whether fraud is committed by the merchant or not using machine learning techniques based on the details of the merchant, customer and order placed by the customer.

## [Project 4: Machine Translator](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Machine_translator)

This project calculates “Customer Lifetime Value” with a proprietary formula to drive marketing decisions and customer relationship management.

## [Project 5: Sentimental Analysis of Movie Reviews](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Movie_Review_Sentimental_Analysis)
This project aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.

## [Project 6: Paraphrasing app](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Para_phrasing)

This projects aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.

## [Project 7: Conversation of Text to Speech](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/NLP_Projects/tree/main/Text_to_Speech)

This projects aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.
